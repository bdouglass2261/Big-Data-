The morning was sunny and warm with temps in the mid 50's to high 60's, with very light wind.....perfect birding weather.  We expected it to be a very quiet, non-birdy July morning, but the birds surprised us!  Many were flying about and/or perched up and singing.  We saw and heard many of the usual suspects for this time of year, like a family of Warbling Vireos, a pair of Cedar Waxwings building a nest, a Spotted Sandpiper on Issaquah Creek, a juvenile Bald Eagle perched on a snag overlooking the lake, a pair of Belted Kingfishers flying quietly up the creek, a juvenile Red-breasted Sapsucker preening on a branch in the shade, several Willow Flycatchers still fitz bewing, about a dozen Swainson's Thrushes still singing in the bushes, several singing Yellow Warblers and Common Yellowthroats, one quiet, male Black-headed Grosbeak, and a family of Bullock's Orioles.  For me, the best bird species of the day was seeing 4 Black Swifts fly overhead about 80 feet up in the bright blue, sunny sky.

In addition to birds, two bats were seen around 5 am; 3 Bunnies; and a few turtles.  From 5:30 to 8:15 am, the three of us surveyed the section north of the P&R lot. It was cloudy, 62-70F, 0-2 mph. The route we followed began at the unpaved trail located at the east corner of the south parking lot at the South Bellevue P&R lot. Then north along the trail bordering the blueberry fields, to the NE corner of same, returning back to the footbridge crossing over the Mercer Slough, walking east on an unpaved trail to 118th Ave SE. Then north to the Pacific Science Center, using the lookouts overlooking the wetlands, then returning on an unpaved trail heading south through the woods to reconnect with the trail heading back down into the Slough. At the bottom of this trail, then north across a creek to walk a loop and returning back to the footbridge across the Slough and then back to the parking lot on the same trail we used at the beginning. From 8:15 to 9:21 am, we surveyed the section south of the P&R lot. Continuing cloudy skies, 70-71F, 5-8 mph. We walked south from the parking lot on a paved biking/walking trail, crossing underneath I90 to view a small cove/marina on Lake Washington. Then, returning back the way we came, making a short stop at the top of the biking/walking bridge high over the southernmost end of the Slough. We ended the census here and returned back to the parking lot (noting only new species not seen earlier in this area).

Early morning birding in the protected drainage on the north side of the ridge was extremely productive. Impressive numbers of birds, including a distracting overabundance of robins and juncos, made for an enjoyable morning despite the wet and cold. With increasing late-morning cloud breaks a return closer to the ridge tops yielded some raptors - including some exciting falcon watching - though car trouble cut my day a bit short. Also seen: one large bull elk, one pika, one rabbit, and an assortment of ground squirrels.----I did finally manage to get my car home, but unfortunately in my fluster managed to leave my camera behind at the intersection where NF-195 heads southwest and briefly follows the ridge/county line (before dropping south into Kittitas county to skirt a small peak) and the road I can't find a number for that wraps around the drainage on the north side of the ridge. My car is out of commission for a while, so I've decided this might be an excuse to get a better birding camera.
