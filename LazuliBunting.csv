We actually saw/heard 39 species!  Plus, we got good looks at several species, with some of the birds staying in our binoculars long enough to be able to see and then to talk about the field marks and vocalizations being made.  Leaving 3 Forks, we warmed up and dried off a bit by stopping for a cup of hot jo at a local coffee place, then headed to Snoqualmie Falls to see the juvenile Peregrine Falcons on the scrape.  Whenever the heavy mist would part long enough, we could see at least 3 of the 4 young falcons, who just a month ago were white and fuzzy fluf balls.  Now, as large and as dark gray as their parents, they are likely hours or days from fledging.  What a neat morning from start to finish!
